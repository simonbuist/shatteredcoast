The Fey are the residents of the [[Feywild]], a plane parallel to [[Gilith]] only accessible through Fey portals. They are mysterious and inconsistent in form. Very little is known to [[Dennar|Dellans]] about them, although the [[Glade Elves]] are much more involved with them.

The Fey divide themselves mostly among [[Four Courts]], corresponding to the seasons. Each court is ruled by a [[Great Fairies|Great Fairy]], a usually-but-not-strictly hereditary position. Certain Fey folk switch Court allegiances, and an even smaller number renounce court allegiance entirely. Both circumstances are rare and the cause of much stir within the [[Feywild]]. Unaligned fairies are viewed with even more suspicion than fairies of other courts.

Formally, the word Fey refers to fairies as a whole or at least as a significantly large enough group to disregard individual actors, while the word Fairies refers to (countably) small numbers. This isn't strictly stuck to, especially among mortals.
