#species 
Drow are the [[Elves]] native to the [[Underdark]], and are one of the 3 species known as the [[Deepfolk]]. Although little is known of their origins, the few Drow academics that have been consulted agree that they originated in [[Elandir]]. This seems to imply that the [[Underdark]] stretches all the way beneath [[Elaram's Lament]] to [[Elandir]].
The small amount of trade that has been established with the Drow has provided goods made from varieties of stone and metals previously unseen in [[Dennar]], and certain fungal woods that have become a desired commodity in [[Dennar]] due to their rarity and elastic properties. Various adventurers claim to have spent time with the Drow, and many of them recount stories particularly of Drow music as being enchantingly beautiful, with echoing vocal and string melodies reminiscent of the home caves.
