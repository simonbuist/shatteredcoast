The Lithan [[Shatterborn Elves]] are one of the surviving populations of [[Elandir]] following the [[Shattering of Elandir]]. Inhabiting the [[Isle of Stanhal]], Lithan Shatterborn live mainly in subterranean cities within the centre of the island. 

At first glance, one might sooner mistake a Lithan for a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] rather than an [[Elves|Elf]], given their shorter heights and more well-built statures. Lithan industry focuses mostly on mining and metallurgy, and their society tends to be more reclusive than the [[Triton Shatterborn|Tritons]] or [[Saurian Shatterborn|Saurians]]. Trade has been established with the Arrusan towns of [[Port Arra]] and [[Dogstail]], but all trade is conducted by Lithan caravans who visit the towns, as no outsiders have been permitted to visit Lithan cities.
