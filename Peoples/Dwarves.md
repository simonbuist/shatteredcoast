#species
Dwarves are a [[Humanoids|Humanoid]] species native to the [[Drakesback]]. They tend to be somewhat shorter than the average human, at 4-5 feet tall.
With their homes along the [[Drakesback]], Dwarven nations have always had a wealth of minerals at their disposal, leading to a culture of artisans focused on metalworking, glassblowing, and the trade of precious minerals. As Dwarven populations grew, they began to rely more heavily on trade with nations outside of the [[Drakesback]] to supplement their inefficient agricultural capacity.

Until the early [[Darktide]], the various dwarven holds were part of a federation known as the [[Crown]]. This was both a practical and metaphorical title, as each hold had provided its most prized jewel as tribute to [[Aml Lodum]], the political and religious capital of the [[Crown]].
Once the [[Darktide]] broke out in full, the [[Crown]] quickly collapsed within a few decades as the Dwarves struggled to defend themselves from the rapidly increasing number of passages to the [[Underdark]]. The disbanding of the [[Crown]] is usually recorded as occurring in 701 [[AS]] In the current day, most living Dwarves have either fled to [[Dennar]] or fortified themselves within their remaining holds, fully cut off from the world. Some companies of dwarves live nomadic lives within the [[Doravar]], raiding [[Deepfolk]] cities for supplies.

A notably distinct Dwarven culture is the sea dwarves, a group who left the mountain halls after contact with [[Dennar]], founding the nation of [[Sazl Korthad]] along the coast.
