#species 
One of the three [[Humanoids]] species collectively known as the [[Deepfolk]], goblins are known for being small people with large personalities. Originating in the Underdark, little is known about Goblin society and its economy. It's believed that they trade communally, rather than having individual possessions, and a goblin gains social status by acquiring wealth or fame for its community.
