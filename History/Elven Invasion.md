The Elven Invasion is the series of wars that subsequently followed the mass migration of [[Elves]] to [[Dennar]] following the [[Shattering of Elandir]]. Although elven ships landed all across [[Dennar]], the largest amount of them came to the [[Silver Sea]] and established territory along its coast, while [[New World Elves]] in other areas assimilated themselves into existing [[Dennar|Dellan]] nations. The new elvish kingdoms began wars with neighbouring states, attempting to expand their borders, culminating in the [[Treaties of Mending]].
