The Crown was the federation of [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] hold built along the [[Doravar]]. The capital of the Crown was [[Aml Lodum]], the most ancient of holds. In 701 [[AS]], the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] war with the [[Deepfolk]] known as the [[Darktide]] caused the Crown to functionally dissolve, with the fall of [[Aml Lodum]].

The Crown got its name from a physical crown forged with the greatest of jewels from each hold. Some [[Dwarves]] escaped with the jewels from their home holds, but most are assumed lost or in possession of the [[Deepfolk]].
