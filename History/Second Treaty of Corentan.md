The Second Treaty of Corentan was signed in 561 [[AS]] by [[Arrusa]], [[Farainne]], and the other member states of the [[Western League]], allowing members of the League to engage in conflict in [[Elandir]] without breaching the [[First Treaty of Corentan]]. Although [[Farainne]] and many other League members were opposed to the new treaty as it clearly benefitted [[Arrusa]] most, given its existing head-start in [[Elandir]], [[Arrusa|Arrusa's]] vital economic role within the League gave it enough sway to push through the new treaty, as the dissolution of the [[Western League]] would make the entire region vulnerable to aggression from the [[Daira]] once again.
