Martalos was the god of war and ruler of the [[Holy Court]] during the [[End of Chaos]], according to [[Dennar|Dellans]]. He led the [[Holy Court]] in battle against the [[Primordial Titans]] and killed [[Aetos]] and [[Nozadon]]. However, after the [[End of Chaos]], he refused to live in peace and attacked his sibling [[Ivris]] along with his followers, a number of minor gods of the [[Holy Court]] in an event referred to as the [[Breaking of Peace]]. He deeply wounded Ivris, almost causing them to die, and as punishment, when defeated, was imprisoned under [[Gilith]] along with his followers.
