Ivris is a member of the [[Holy Court]], and the most worshipped among them. Ivris was the sibling of [[Martalos]] and parent of [[Idos]] and [[Ilsyen]], the King and Queen of the [[Holy Court]]. Ivris's domain is peace and life. During the [[Breaking of Peace]], Ivris was attacked by [[Martalos]] and barely survived, which is the mythological reason why death exists in the world.
