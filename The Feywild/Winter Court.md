The Winter Court is one of the [[Four Courts|four Fey courts]] of the [[Feywild]]. The court has been led for the last 1500 years by the Lady of Deep Ice. Other notable Archfey of the Winter Court include the Archivist, Lord Squall, Jack Frost, and the Blue Knight.
The Winter Court is often spared the level of overt conflict common to the other courts, as fighting is portrayed as crass and of the mortals. This leads many Winter [[Fey|fairies]] to hold a particular disdain for the [[Summer Court]].
Many of the world's most prominent scholars are Winter [[Fey|fairies]], and the greatest known libraries also exist within it. The largest of these libraries is the Archive of Winterseat, located beside the Palace of Winterseat, home of the Lady of Deep Ice, within the capital city of Winterseat.
