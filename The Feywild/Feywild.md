#region #Feywild
The Feywild is another plane closely linked to [[Gilith]] filled with dense, magical forests, home to the [[Four Courts]]. Similar to the [[Underdark]], transit between them is only possible in a small number of locations. However, different from the [[Underdark]], [[Fey]] portals are required to cross between them. The [[Fey]] inhabit the Feywild, ruled by the [[Great Fairies]]. Some adventurers claim to have entered the Feywild, but their stories are received skeptically. Some scholars believe the Feywild might not even exist.
