The Archive of Winterseat is the largest library in all of [[Gilith]], with a collection amassed over millennia. It is located in [[Winterseat]], capital of the [[Winter Court]], and has been stewarded by the Archivist for longer than any can remember. Scholars of the Archive work cooperatively to collect copies of all works ever written, and to document and collate the knowledge within them. More recently, some more radical members of the Archive, supported by Florian, have been pushing to engage with the [[University of Gnimscal]] and the [[Great College]] academically, though this has been harshly discouraged by the [[Lady of Deep Ice]].
