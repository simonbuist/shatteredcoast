Widely considered one of the most beautiful features of [[Farum Rex]], and [[Elandir]] as a whole, the Orchard is a region of beautiful flowering trees. Every spring the trees bloom, and on the Spring Equinox the town holds a festival, Florapicem. This festival is widely attended, and for the few nights surrounding the holiday, the glow of the blooms leaves nights almost as bright as days.
