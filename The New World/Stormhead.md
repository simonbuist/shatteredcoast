Stormhead is a northwestern city on the [[Isle of Stanhal]], and is seen as the last port in the [[Narrows of Elfhome]] before it opens up into the broader [[Shattered Coast]]. While nominally a territory of [[Arrusa]], Stormhead functions mostly autonomously and has much fewer permament residents than [[Port Arra]] and [[Dogstail]]. Only 400 or so people live there permanently, while the rest of the population is sailors, traders, and adventurers who are just passing through.

Stormhead is located at the base of rocky peninsula of [[Knifeshead]], and gets its name from the frequency of storms that come across from the [[Shattered Coast]].
