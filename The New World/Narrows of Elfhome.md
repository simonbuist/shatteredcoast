#region #Elandir
The Narrows of Elfhome lie below the [[Isle of Stanhal]], and was the first rediscovered region of the [[Shattered Coast]]. The Narrows are very inhabited, being home to [[Saurian Shatterborn|Saurian]], [[Triton Shatterborn|Triton]], and [[Lithan Shatterborn|Lithan]] [[Shatterborn Elves]].
The two largest [[Dennar|Dellan]] cities in the Narrows are [[New Linnar]] and [[Port Arra]], controlled by [[Ayllath]] and [[Arrusa]] respectively.

The Narrows contain a much larger population of [[Dennar|Dellans]] as compared to the rest of the [[Shattered Coast]] due to its more mild weather, a result of its sheltered location protecting it from the worst of the storms common to the rest of the sea.
