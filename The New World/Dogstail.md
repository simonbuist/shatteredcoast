Dogstail is an [[Arrusa|Arrusan]] town located on the southern coast of the [[Isle of Stanhal]] in [[Elandir]], along the coast of the [[Narrows of Elfhome]]. Dogstail's reputation as a seedier locale comes from its comparative lack of government presence and the prominence of its smuggling guilds.

Dogstail is built upon a small plateau surrounded by the marshes that occupy most of the western region of the [[Isle of Stanhal]], and everyone has heard about its pervasive fetid scent.

Most people only visit Dogstail if they have a particular need that can only be satisfied within the town, be that rare or illicit goods only available from smugglers, a place to lay low, or the less-legal services offered only there.
