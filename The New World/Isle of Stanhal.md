The Isle of Stanhal is the largest island in the [[Shattered Coast]], home to the [[Lithan Shatterborn]]. The island is bisected by a large wall of cliffs isolating the lower, marshy western regions from the higher, arid eastern regions.

The southern coasts of the island, forming the northern border of the [[Narrows of Elfhome]], are currently under [[Arrusa|Arrusan]] control. [[Port Arra]] and [[Dogstail]] are the most visited towns, with [[Stormhead]] serving as a resupply point to the west.
