The Gnommo Republics are a gnumber of gnations along the gnorthern coast of [[Dennar]], inhabited by [[Gnomes]]. Some of the republics are located on islands in the regions as well. The Gnommo Republics are democracies that avoid war, believing it to be damaging and unproductive, preferring to interact with the rest of [[Dennar]] through trade and study. The Gnommo Republics are famous for their universities and workshops, in which the [[Gnomes|Gnommish]] artificers refine their craft and manipulate the power of [[Aetshard|Aetshards]]. Despite their distaste for war, [[Daira]] sees them as a possible target for further expansion, and in the past has conquered the [[Gnomes|Gnommish]] lands east of the [[Desvin Mountains]].
