#region #Dennar
The Eldglade is an ancient forest covering southeastern [[Dennar]], known in ancient times as the domain of the [[Fey]]. In the century following the [[Shattering of Elandir]], the presence of [[Glade Elves]] within the Eldglade appeared. During the later [[Darktide]], after the dissolution of the [[Crown]], [[Deepfolk]] began to move into the Eldglade, although they mainly stuck to the outer Eldglade, the less dense and mystical portions of the forest. Within recent years, it seems like the [[Glade Elves]] have reached some level of peace with the [[Deepfolk]], retaining their territory within the centre of the Eldglade, and [[Glade Elves|Glade Elf]] trade boats are once again reaching the rest of [[Dennar]], carrying goods made of [[Metalwood]] and instruments of legendary craftsmanship.
