A former Duchy of the [[Alkainon Empire]], which seceded in 620 [[AS]] due to the imposition of harsh tariffs on trade from the [[Glade Elves]] of the [[Eldglade]] and the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Crown]] in the [[Drakesback]]. The tariffs were imposed to fund the increase of army to deter aggression from the [[Naira|Kingdom of Naira]]. Initially, war was considered to retain Alkannor within the Empire, but this was averted with the signing of a defensive pact between the two sides in the event of invasion.

The northern part of Alkannor is marshy and not well suited for agriculture, leaving it very sparsely populated, while the southern part is heavily populated, profiting from fertile farmland and trade of goods considered too valuable to risk shipping through [[Drakesmouth Bay]].
