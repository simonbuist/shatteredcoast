A former region of [[Sazl Korthad]], Eastport is a republic on [[Drakesmouth Bay]] famed for its expert sailors capable of navigating the storms of the Bay. It gained its independence in 717 [[AS]], after the weakening and decentralization of [[Sazl Korthad]] following the dissolution of the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Crown]].
Eastport's government is led by a council of representatives elected for life, with its laissez-faire style of governance leading it to become a popular place of migration for all sorts of disaffected people. It is politically dominated by its merchant guilds, and is seen by some as an oligarchy.
