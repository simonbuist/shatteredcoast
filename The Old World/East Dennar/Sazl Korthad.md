Sazl Korthad is one of the remaining [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] holds, uniquely situated outside of the [[Drakesback]] along the coast of the [[Arietan Sea]]. Sazl Korthad initially grew as a trading port for the [[Dwarves]] of [[Ovl Dareth]], but over time gained independence as its population and wealth began to overshadow [[Ovl Dareth]]. In 576 [[AS]], it was recognized as its own hold under the [[Crown]], and its residents were named the Pearl Dwarves.

After the [[Crown]] was dissolved, Sazl Korthad became a fully autonomous region, mostly escaping the devastation experienced by the other holds during the [[Darktide]], and its trade became much more integrated with the other nations of [[Dennar]]. The northern part of Sazl Korthad broke away after integration and migration with its surrounding neighbours, after a fairly minor civil war. This region is now known as [[Eastport]].
