Drakesmouth Bay is the easternmost portion of the [[Arietan Sea]]. It's particularly stormy, making it difficult for smaller ships to navigate. The larger vessels and experienced sailors of [[Eastport]] and [[Sazl Korthad]] can manage the storms, but there still is significant risk associated with the journey. As a result, trade of luxury items between the [[Eldglade]] and the rest of [[Dennar]] often occurs over land, through [[Alkannor]]. Within the Bay lies [[Alenic]], the religious heart of [[Dennar]].
