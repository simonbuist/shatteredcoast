#region #Doravar
The Doravar, or the Ancient Dwarfroad, is a series of massive tunnels excavated throughout the [[Drakesback]], originating in [[Aml Lodum]] and eventually stretching across much of the world. Along the Doravar, many [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] holds were founded over the course of thousands of years, eventually leading to the formation of the [[Crown]].
