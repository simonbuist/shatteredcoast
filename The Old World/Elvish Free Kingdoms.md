#region #Dennar 
The Elvish Free Kingdoms are a number of states established by the [[Treaties of Mending]], mainly populated by [[New World Elves]] and [[Humans]]. They are in central [[Dennar]], mostly located around the [[Silver Sea]]. While more Elvish kingdoms existed in the region in past, many were conquered by [[Alkaios]] and incorporated into the [[Alkainon Empire]]. The largest of these kingdoms are [[Nueleth]] and [[Isle-Nasir]].
