The Kingdom of Naira is a fairly recently formed country, forming during the upheaval caused by the [[Elven Invasion]]. It lies to the north of the [[Silver Sea]], and its inhabitants include mainly [[Humans]], [[Gnomes]], and [[Old World Elves]]. The Kingdom originated as a minor independent state within [[Dennar]], but aggressively expanded throughout the 3rd century [[AS]]. Its southern expansion was halted by the [[Treaties of Mending]], and its southwestern expansion was stopped by the formation of the [[Western League]] after the [[First Treaty of Corentan]]. It still occasionally goes to war with the [[Gnommo Republics]], but has not found success in crossing the mountain range separating the two regions. The northern frontier is still in constant conflict with the large number of smaller states and free cities. The Kingdom of Daira has also become engaged in fighting alongside the [[Alkainon Empire]] in [[Althan]] in the [[Darktide]].
