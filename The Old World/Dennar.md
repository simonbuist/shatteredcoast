# History
Dennar, also known as the Old World, is a region of [[Gilith]] originally populated by [[Gnomes]] in the northwest, [[Giants]] in the northeast, and [[Humans]] in the south. Dellan societies are known to have existed on the land for at least a millennium prior to the [[Shattering of Elandir]].
Soon after 0 [[AS]], a migration of [[Elves]] fleeing the [[Shattering of Elandir]] began to arrive, causing a political upheaval and series of wars as various [[Elves|Elven]] groups arrived and began integrating into existing nations or conquering land. This period of war between the [[Old World Elves]] and the allied [[Gnomes]] and [[Humans]], known as the [[Elven Invasion]], lasted over 2 centuries, finally ending with the signing of the [[Treaties of Mending]] in 227 [[AS]], recognizing Elven nations and establishing borders. 
Aside from minor wars, this period of peace lasted another century, until 344 [[AS]], the start of [[Alkaios|Alkaios's]] conquest of central Dennar, eventually resulting in the [[Alkainon Empire]], eventually halted by a coalition of the [[Elvish Free Kingdoms]], the [[Western League]], and the [[Gnommo Republics]]. 
After the death of [[Alkaios]], a succession crisis of his 7 children led to a major decentralization of the [[Alkainon Empire]], although they remain politically united. 
During the 5th century [[AS]], [[Arrusa]] rose to prominence among the members of the [[Western League]] and its massive coastline led it to establish trade networks across the [[Arietan Sea]] to [[Marral]] and [[Esden]].
In order to both compete with growing [[Arrusa|Arrusan]] trade dominance and to rediscover their homeland, the [[Elvish Free Kingdoms|Elvish Kingdom]] of [[Ayllath]] invested heavily in its own commercial navy, which discovered a route to [[Elandir]] in 512 [[AS]]. This led to a number of exploratory and colonial expeditions to [[Elandir]], establishing ports and diplomatic relations with the [[Shatterborn Elves]] living there.
In 683 [[AS]], a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] mine in the [[Drakesback]] broke into the [[Underdark]], and the dwarves made contact with the nearby [[Goblins]] population. Although trade relations were established initially, further [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] expansion into the [[Underdark]] resulted in retaliation in 685 [[AS]]. This escalated into full-blown war between the [[Dwarves]] and the allied [[Goblins]], [[Orcs]], and [[Drow]]. This war was the start of the [[Darktide]], a conflict which has now reached eastern Dennar.
