The Western League is a long-lasting defensive alliance among nations to the west of the [[Silver Sea]], originally formed by [[Farainne]] with the [[First Treaty of Corentan]] to stop expansion of the [[Naira]] from the north. The two largest countries within the League are [[Arrusa]] and [[Farainne]], respectively the economic and military centres of the League. After the rediscovery and colonization of [[Elandir]], the [[Second Treaty of Corentan]] was established, allowing conflict within the [[Elandir]] between League states so as to preserve the power of the League.
