#country #Dennar
Arrusa is the largest country within the [[Western League]], with very strong commercial navy bringing it wealth and prominence within [[Dennar]]. Over time, it has become the de facto leader of the [[Western League]], with many smaller nations as its vassals or otherwise under its protection. Within the [[Western League]] its greatest rival is [[Farainne]], whose military might is still likely slightly greater. Outside the [[Western League]], Arrusa frequently is at war with the [[Naira]] to the northeast, and peace is mostly maintained with the [[Gnommo Republics]].
