The Kingdom of Ayllath is located on the eastern coast of the [[Silver Sea]], to the north of [[Nueleth]]. Ayllath is famed for its naval expertise, and its close diplomatic ties with the rest of the [[Elvish Free Kingdoms]]. Ayllathi explorers were the first to rediscover [[Elandir]], and spearheaded the trade and colonization there. Ayllathi explorers were quickly able to build positive relations with the nations of [[Shatterborn Elves]] along the [[Shattered Coast]], and as such build an effective foothold into the land. This has allowed them to viably compete with the more powerful country of [[Arrusa]] in the [[Shattered Coast]].
