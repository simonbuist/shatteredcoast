Metalwood is a mysterious material sourced from the [[Glade Elves]] of the [[Eldglade]]. Most scholars agree it is a type of wood, but it's unclear how the [[Glade Elves]] are able to create goods with it. It's as hard as rock, but far lighter, and resists most transmutation magic applied to it. Particularly wealthy [[Dennar|Dellan]] nobles often commission signet rings made of Metalwood, as there's no known way to craft forgeries.
