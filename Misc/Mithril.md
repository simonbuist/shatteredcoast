Mithril is a holy metal to the [[Dwarves]], treasured for its religious connections to the souls of deceased [[Dwarves]]. Others prize it for its incredibly desirable physical qualities of lightness, hardness, high melting point, and ductility when heated. It is not known if there are still any functioning forges capable of producing the levels of heat necessary to work mithril after the breaking of the [[Crown]]. The two holds, built into volcanoes, known to contain these forges are [[Aml Lodum]], which was conquered in the [[Darktide]], and [[Ovl Thendr]], with which contact has not been made for decades.
